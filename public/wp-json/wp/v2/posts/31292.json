Furthermore, in order to operate a full-fledged construction company, you must obtain several approvals and licenses. Here is a step-by-step process to do it:<\/span><\/p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choose the organization&#8217;s location and structure<\/span><\/h4><\/li><\/ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first choice to make if you want to start a construction firm in Dubai is whether to register for a mainland company or choose a free zone establishment. In the case of Mainland company formation, a license can be obtained without local as well, the only condition they should hire one skilled engineer within 6 months from the release of this trade license. Also, Dubai Municipality approval is required. Customers must obtain a separate office Ejari for conducting this kind of activity on the Mainland. On the other hand, G+1 License must have a local sponsor who is registered in the Engineer association club and contains no other similar firm under his name. However, while establishing a business in a free zone, no local sponsor is required to possess any stock in your business. You become the sole proprietor of the business. You must weigh all of the benefits and drawbacks of both options before selecting the one that is ideal for your company.<\/span><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aaconsultancy.ae\/dubai\/difference-between-mainland-freezone-company-uae\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click here to read the difference between mainland and freezone<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Submit a license application<\/span><\/h4><\/li><\/ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free zones have their own independent governing bodies. Therefore, you must approach the relevant government if you want to apply for a construction license in the free zone. On the other hand, if you are requesting a license on the mainland, you must contact the Department of Economic Development (DED). A construction company&#8217;s legal license is within the commercial category. Additionally, certain company activities require various permits and supplementary authorization. List your activities before submitting a licensing application.<\/span><\/p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><h4><strong>Obtain the construction permit<\/strong><\/h4><\/li><\/ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have a license for your Dubai construction company, you must seek a building permit in order to be eligible for different business concessions. As a result, you should collaborate with civil engineers and business advisors who can help you get the permit. Shuraa&#8217;s business experts assist you in acquiring the same by handling all the labor-intensive tasks.<\/span><\/p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obtain additional licenses and permits that are required.<\/span><\/h4><\/li><\/ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A construction company in the UAE must additionally obtain additional certificates and approvals in addition to the building permit. G+1 permits are necessary for establishments in free zones, although construction licenses are available to mainland businesses. The building maintenance license, a license for steel construction contracting, and more are examples of other crucial licenses.<\/span><\/p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><h4><strong>Recognize your constraints and provisions<\/strong><\/h4><\/li><\/ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any company organization must abide by the laws and rules that are upheld by the government in that nation. The UAE provides cutting-edge infrastructure, forgiving tax regulations, and business-friendly policies to strengthen the working ecosystem in the nation. To make sure you do not break any rules, you must be aware of the restrictions on your construction license. To manage a hassle-free construction firm in Dubai, the business professionals in Dubai help you understand what you can do and what you should avoid.<\/span><\/p><ul><li><h4><strong> Take care of visas and establish a business bank account<\/strong><\/h4><\/li><\/ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Dubai, obtaining an investment visa is simple if you are a high-end investor. If not, there is no need for concern. You only need to abide by the laws that have been established for visa issuing and submit your visa application. Depending on your needs, you can get visas for your family, domestic help, and more. After everything else is completed, you can open a business account in the bank that best suits your activities and transactions for your construction company.<\/span><\/p><p><a href=\"tel:+971564086728\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact us for more information about the services<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aaconsultancy.ae\/dubai\/benefits-of-uae-free-zone-company\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read more about the benefits of Freezone<\/span><\/a><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><h2><b>Necessary Permits Needed to Launch a Construction Company in Dubai<\/b><\/h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After obtaining the required permits, you must obtain the following government approvals in order to launch a construction company:<\/span><\/p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Dubai Water and Electricity Authority must approve requests before the business may obtain the necessities<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Department of Drainage and Irrigation: This division is in charge of providing disposable services and managing liquid waste<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Building Department and Dubai Civil Defense Authority monitor if the construction company is adhering to the applicable construction laws<\/span><\/li><\/ul><p><a href=\"tel:+971564086728\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact us to learn more<\/span><\/a><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aaconsultancy.ae\/dubai\/2022\/06\/25\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read more<\/span><\/a><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><h2><b>Different Dubai Construction License Types<\/b><\/h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can submit an application for a construction license based on your area of interest.
