Included in this are partners, kids, parents, and siblings. A residency visa will be issued to the sponsored family members, enabling them to remain and work in Dubai.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The visa is an excellent choice for anybody wishing to move to the country at least temporarily because it is extendable for a further three years. There are several things to keep in mind, though. The partner must be of a different sex than the UAE national or resident. The applicant must also send an application form, a copy of their passport, and a photo in order to apply for the visa. The AED 2000 (about $550) visa fee is subject to change. The holder of the visa may work in Dubai, but they must first receive a work permit from the Ministry of Labor. The visa holder may also pursue education in Dubai.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this visa, you can study without needing a student visa, but you will still need to register with the Ministry of Education. Overall, families can live and work in Dubai with the help of the Dubai family visa. They get the chance to take advantage of everything Dubai has to offer!

They will be asked to submit to some medical exams during that health check, though. This covers blood testing, female pregnancy tests, and assessments of liver health. Additionally, each family member must possess a current passport.<\/span>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.aaconsultancy.ae\/dubai\/simple-ways-to-set-up-an-ecommerce-business-in-dubai\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read more<\/span><\/a>\n<h2><b>Documents Required for Family Visa in the UAE<\/b><\/h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To obtain a family visa 3 main documents are a Birth certificate, Marriage certificate &amp; Residential Ejari. Family members must carry original copies of various documents in order to enter the UAE. The Birth &amp; Marriage certificate mandatorily has to be attested by the Home country &amp; UAE Ministry of Foreign affairs. Most of these documents also require certification in your country of origin. But as the majority of these records are certified copies of birth and marriage certificates, they probably already have certification.<\/span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Properly completed and signed application for a UAE visa<\/span><\/li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Passport-size photos of the candidate taken recently<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A copy of the resident&#8217;s passport and visa for residence in the UAE<\/span><\/li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marriage license for your spouse that has been attested<\/span><\/li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Birth certificates that have been attested for minors under the age of 21<\/span><\/li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Letter of sponsorship expressing no objections to a fitness certificate<\/span><\/li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Travel itinerary\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When applying for a UAE family visa, the UAE embassy or consulate may also require other documents in addition to those listed above. This is crucial to remember since they have the right to request any further supporting materials need to evaluate your case. Please be aware that this is the reason why we advise working with a reputable company that has experience with this type of visa procedure.<\/span>\n<h2><b>Opening Date for UAE Family Visas<\/b><\/h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do we mean by the opening date for UAE family visas? This is the deadline for applying for your family&#8217;s visas if you choose to do so. Currently, if you are the resident sponsor, you have 60 days from the time you arrive in the UAE to apply for the dependents&#8217; residency permits. Keep in mind that these 60 days begin when you go from having admission permission to becoming a resident. When the 60-day period has passed, where do you begin this process? At the nearby GDRFA office in Dubai, you can submit an application for a family visa for Dubai.<\/span>\n<h2><b>Family Visa Cost in Dubai<\/b><\/h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dubai residents can apply for employee family visas and partner family visas, which have different prices. Each person resident inside the country (UAE) needs to have a budget of AED 4000\u2013AED 5000 for employee visas. Additionally, a person should have a budget of AED 5500\u2013AED 6,000 for an investor family visa if they plan to live inside the nation, including security deposits that are refundable when the visa is canceled.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you intend to relocate to Dubai with your family, you definitely have some questions regarding how much a family visa will cost. The good news is that Dubai&#8217;s family visa fees are reasonable, especially when compared to those of other nations in the region. A family of four should budget about AED 5,000 (about $1,360 USD) for their visas as mentioned above. The cost of processing and granting the visas, as well as any related expenses like medical testing or travel insurance, are covered by this price.\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting a visa inside the country is AED 1176 and outside the country is AED 580. The one-time cost of File opening is AED 280 and medical normal will cost AED 350. The cost of getting an Emirates ID for 2 and 3 years are AED 275 and AED 375 respectively with an additional AED 650 for stamping. For a status change, the cost is AED 676.\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of family members and length of stay may affect the actual cost. However, the price of a family visa for Dubai is relatively affordable, so you should not let that stop you from applying.\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<a href=\"tel:+971564086728\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact us<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span>\n<h2><b>How to Apply for the Family Visa in Dubai: Step-by-Step<\/b><\/h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After seeing how simple it is to relocate to Dubai with your family, are you now considering doing so?
