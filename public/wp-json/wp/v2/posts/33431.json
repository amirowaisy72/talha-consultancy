Social media allows users to engage with customers on a one-to-one basis, build a unique brand, and market to a large audience, and social media helps boost traffic to your products, blogs, or website for higher sales figures.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selling on social media in Dubai, United Arab Emirates is completely legal as long as you have a valid trade license and visa. Due to the rise of counterfeit products and other illegal transactions on social media platforms, the UAE government has the authority to close down any online shops and illegal websites with penalties of up to AED 500,000 for lawbreakers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we have mentioned before, there are two types of trade licenses available for online shopping <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aaconsultancy.ae\/dubai\/business-setup-dubai\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business setup<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for foreign nationals: e-Trader or Social Media Influencer License and eCommerce License.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><h2><b>Best Trade License for Selling and Buying on Social Media<\/b><\/h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two most common types of trade licenses are e-commerce licenses and e-trader licenses.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><h3><b>e-Trader License or Social Media Influencer License<\/b><\/h3><\/li><\/ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This license known as an e-trader license or social media influencer license is aimed at individuals who are selling on social media. A Social Media Influencer or Brand Ambassador is considered a business activity in the UAE. The Electronics Media Regulation Law 2019 established the e-trader license and also defined its scope and functions: e-trader license is for a single shareholder or a freelancer working from home. This type of company cannot hire staff, open a physical shop, or rent a space.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><h3><b>e-Commerce License<\/b><\/h3><\/li><\/ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An e-commerce license is issued by the Ministry of Economy and the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority. It entitles an individual to sell items on social media in a regulated way \u2013 for the seller and buyer\u2019s protection.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With just a few simple steps, you can start your own ecommerce company.

The steps for obtaining a trade license are pretty straightforward. Following the steps listed below will help you to obtain a trade license for your social media business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><h3><b>Step 1: Partner with a Trade License Zone<\/b><\/h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partnering with any <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aaconsultancy.ae\/dubai\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business setup consultants in Dubai<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> such as A&amp;A Associate can make things easier for you. To benefit from all the legal structures of operating with a trade license, you have to follow certain business structures and formation regulations. Our team of specialists at A&amp;A Associate will help you manage all the aspects of your company\u2019s formation process and guide you on the various municipal and governmental trade regulations for operating in the UAE.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><h3><b>Step 2: Choose a Business Structure<\/b><\/h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free zones are special economic zones for dedicated industries such as e-commerce sales and ecommerce business. The different free zones in Dubai offer various benefits such as business support services and tax incentives designed for each industry. Free zones not only offer you trade licenses to businesses but also access to business clients, infrastructure, skilled workers, and a high volume of customers. A free zone company gives you access to the local and world market.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><h3><b>Step 3: Choose and Register a Unique Business Name<\/b><\/h3><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aaconsultancy.ae\/dubai\/business-setup-dubai\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business setup consultants in Dubai<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> such as A&amp;A Associate can help you choose the right name for your online business and ecommerce license. According to Dubai\u2019s Registry office, business names must not include any offensive or blasphemous language. As a foreign investor, you can include your name in your company name for the Dubai economy and the UAE market, but you must use your name in full rather than just your initials or surname.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><h3><b>Step 4: Notarize Your Company Documents<\/b><\/h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this step, you will need to apply for the notarization of your company\u2019s documents.
