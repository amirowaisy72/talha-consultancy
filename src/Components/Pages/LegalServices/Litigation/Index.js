                Our litigation attorneys take a significant number of matters to
                trial each year. As such we are highly skilled and efficient in
                conducting the strategic and tactical preparations that can make
                or break a case.
              </p>
              <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                Our team first performs extensive early case analysis to
                identify the case’s strengths and weaknesses and determine the
                most effective means of achieving a favorable resolution,
                including if litigation can or should be avoided or settlement
                is advisable. We understand our clients’ businesses, and know
                how to prioritize litigation within the overall scope of their
                business operations. We staff based on the needs of each
                individual case, and have the ability to draw from a deep pool
                of veteran litigators when stakes are high. We also leverage the
                latest litigation support technology to reduce client costs and
                improve efficiency.
