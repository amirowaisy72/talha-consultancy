                              Accounting and bookkeeping are both essential
                              functions in managing a company’s financial
                              records, but they differ in terms of scope and
                              complexity. Bookkeeping primarily involves the
                              systematic recording, organizing, and categorizing
                              of financial transactions, such as sales,
                              purchases, receipts, and payments. It focuses on
                              maintaining accurate and up-to-date financial
                              records. On the other hand, accounting encompasses
                              a broader set of activities, including
                              interpreting and analyzing financial data,
                              preparing financial statements, conducting
                              financial planning, and providing insights for
                              decision-making.
